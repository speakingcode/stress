STRESS
======

Stupid, Tedious, Redundant, Elusive Style Sheets
----------------------------------------------

STRESS is a CSS Preprocessor that brings all the functionality you would expect out of a stressfully stupid styling language. Elusive properties whose effects are difficult to predict, a syntax that is slow to write, and a choatic mix of accepted values and types that make styling your webpages a pain. Additionally, it removes variables, reusability and other generlization techniques in favor of tedious, verbose repetition.

### STRESS has the following features:

- Superset of CSS, so the entire CSS language is supported
- Native support in most modern browsers - no dependencies to install in order to STRESS out your web development
- No additional syntax, keywords, or constructs - If you know CSS, you're already STRESSing
- STRESS works seamlessly with FUSS (Fucking Ugly CSS)
