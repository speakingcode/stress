STRESS
======

Stupid, Totally Retarded, Elusive Style Sheets
----------------------------------------------

STRESS is a CSS Preprocessor that brings all the functionality you would expect out of a stressfully stupid styling language. Elusive properties whose effects are difficult to predict, a syntax that is slow to write, and a choatic mix of accepted values and types that make styling your webpages a pain. Additionally, it removes variables, reusability and other generlization techniques in favor of tedious, verbose repetition.

STRESS is a superset of standard CSS, adding these additonal constructs:

- Nothing
- At
- All


STRESS is closely related to FUSS (Fucking Ugly CSS)
